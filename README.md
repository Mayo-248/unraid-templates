# TeamSpeak 6 Server (Beta) - Unraid Docker Template

## ℹ️ Overview
This repository provides a ready-to-use **Unraid Docker Template** for the official **TeamSpeak 6 Server (Beta)**. 

Since the TS6 Server is currently in Beta and not yet available in the official Unraid Community Applications (CA), I created this template to allow for an easy, "one-click" installation. It pre-configures all necessary ports and, most importantly, fixes the permission issues often encountered on Unraid.

## ⚡ Features & Fixes
* **Official Image:** pulls `teamspeaksystems/teamspeak6-server:latest`.
* **Permissions Fix:** Automatically includes the `--user 99:100` parameter. This forces the container to run as Unraid's default user, preventing the common *"Failed to create log directory"* crash loop.
* **Pre-configured Ports:** * `9987/udp` (Voice)
  * `30033/tcp` (File Transfer)
  * `10080/tcp` (Web Query)

## 🛠️ Installation on Unraid
1. Open the file `my-TeamSpeak6-Server-Beta.xml` in this repository.
2. Click on the **Raw** button to get the direct file URL.
3. Save the XML file to your Unraid flash drive at:
   `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/`
4. Go to your **Unraid Docker** tab and click **"Add Container"**.
5. Select **"TeamSpeak6-Server-Beta"** from the "Template" dropdown menu.
6. Click **Apply**.

## 🔑 How to get your Admin Token
On the very first start, the server generates a one-time privilege key (token) that you need to claim ownership of your server.

1. Start the container.
2. Click on the container icon and select **Logs**.
3. Search for the line: `ServerAdmin privilege key`.
4. Copy the key and paste it into your TS6 Client when prompted.

## ⚠️ Beta Limitations
Please be aware that TeamSpeak 6 is currently in **Beta**:
* **No Migration:** You cannot migrate data from TeamSpeak 3 to TeamSpeak 6.
* **Licenses:** Old TS3 licenses are not compatible. The server comes with a 32-slot Beta license that auto-renews.
* **Bugs:** As this is beta software, expect occasional bugs or changes in functionality.
